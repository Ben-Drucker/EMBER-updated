Project: EMBER
=========
EMBER: Embedding-based multi-label prediction of phosphorylation events
Developer: Kathryn E. Kirchoff from Gomez Lab (Computational Systems Biology & Network Medicine) at University of North Carolinaâ€”Chapel Hill. 

Requirements
=========
    torch==1.3.1
    numpy>=1.17.2

Obtain Siamese embedding.
=========
It is necessary to obtain the Siamese embedding because it is too large to be uploaded on github. Simply run the Siamese file. The model weights are saved. You may train your own network according to the code in the network.

Train EMBER (prediction network).
=========
Run the notebook to train EMBER network. Test data and training data utilized for the paper are provided.

Test EMBER (prediction network).
=====
You may test the network using our provided test set or use your own test set.
